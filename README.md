Over the past few years I got really into sewing bike packs and I decided it would be fun to create a bike pack 'builder' that allows users to create their own custom bike packs. One view allows a user to browse my previous projects, and another view allows the user to 'build' a bike pack. This project is built with Vue.js and Bootstrap-Vue.

Current Functionality
- Users can select the type of bike pack they want
- Users can select the colors of the bike pack features
- Users can input the size of their bike frame

Future Functionality
- The frame dimensions entered by the user will be used to calculate a custom bike pack shape with accurate angles, and this image will be rendered in real time
- Improved visualizations with actual photos of the fabric overlayed on the bike pack shape (replacing the simple colors that currently exist)
- The 'submit' button will submit an email with all of the inputs filled out in the form
